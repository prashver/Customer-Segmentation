# Customer-Segmentation

Market segmentation is crucial for marketers since it enables them to launch targeted ad marketing campaigns that are tailored to customer's specific needs. In this project, I have trained an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to perform bank customer segmentation. This project could be practically applied at any marketing department in the banking and retail industries to segment customers into 'clusters' or 'groups'.

The notebook covers the following tasks:
- Import libraries and datasets
- Visualize and explore datasets
- Use Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
- Apply k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
